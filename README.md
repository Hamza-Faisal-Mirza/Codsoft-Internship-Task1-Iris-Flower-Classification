# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
# Objectives Of The Code:

# 1. Data Loading : It loads the Iris flower dataset from a CSV file (IRIS.csv).

# 2. Data Preprocessing :
  # - It splits the data into features (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width) and the target variable (species).
  # - Encodes the target variable into numerical values for classification.

# 3.  Data Splitting : Splits the data into a training set and a testing set (70% training, 30% testing).

# 4.  Model Selection and Training :
 #  - Chooses the Random Forest Classifier as the machine learning model.
 #  - Trains the Random Forest model using the training data, allowing it to learn from the sepal and petal measurements.

# 5.  Model Evaluation :
 #  - Evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy and generating a classification report, which includes precision, recall, F1-score, and other classification metrics.

# 6.  Make Predictions :
  # - Demonstrates the model's predictive capabilities by making predictions on new data (a hypothetical sample with sepal and petal measurements) using the trained model.
